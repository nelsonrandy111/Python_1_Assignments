The file will be in notebook form. 
 
 Exercise 1: Print a Greeting
 ● Write a Python program that prints a greeting message, such as "Hello, Python!".
 Exercise 2: Basic Arithmetic
 ● Create a program that:
 ○ Defines two variables, a and b, with numerical values.
 ○ Prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
 Exercise 3: String Manipulation
 ● Define a variable name and assign it your name. Write a program that prints a message saying 
"Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the value of the variable.
Python - Lists and Dictionaries
 Exercise 4: Lists
 ● Create a list called universities with at least five different university names.
 ● Print the entire list.
 ● Print the first and last university in the list.
 Exercise 5: Dictionaries
 ● Create a dictionary called student with keys: name, age, and grade, and assign appropriate 
values to each key.
 ● Write a program that prints each key-value pair in the dictionary.
Python - Tuples and Sets
 Exercise 6: Tuples
 ● Define a tuple called coordinates with two values representing a point in 2D space (e.g., (x, y)).
 ● Print the value of coordinates and access each element by its index.
 Exercise 7: Sets
 ● Create a set called colors with the values: "red", "green", "blue".
 ● Add another color to the set.
 ● Try adding a duplicate color and observe what happens.
 ● Print the set and remove one color from it.
 ● Create another set named light_colors and merge colors and light_colors.
Python - Control flow
 Exercise 8: Conditional Statements
 ● Write a program that:
 ○ Takes an input number from the user.
 ○ Checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
 ○ Prints an appropriate message based on the result.
 Exercise 9: For Loop
 ● Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5.
 ● Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print each number.
 Exercise 10: While Loop
 ● Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
 ● Ensure the loop terminates correctly.
Python - Control flow
 Exercise 11: Match Statement (Python 3.10+)
 ● Write a program that:
 ○ Asks the user to input a grade (e.g., "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F").
 ○ Use a match statement to print a corresponding message for each grade:
 ■ "A": "Excellent!"
 ■ "B": "Good job!"
 ■ "C": "Fair."
 ■ "D": "Needs improvement."
 ■ "F": "Failing."
 ○ Handle invalid input by printing a default message.
Python - Function
 Exercise 12: Define a Function
 ● Write a function called greet that takes a name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".
 ● Call the function with your own name.
 Exercise 13: Function with Return Value
 ● Define a function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.
 ● Print the result of calling this function with different numbers.
 Exercise 14: Function with Default Parameters
 ● Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their product. 
Set a default value of 1 for the parameter b.
 ● Test the function with and without providing the second argument.
Python - Combining all we learned
 Exercise 15: List Comprehension
 ● Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
 ● Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains the squares of these numbers.
 ● Print the new list.
 Exercise 16: Nested Data Structures
 ● Create a dictionary where the keys are names of students and the values are lists of their grades.
 ● Write a function that takes the dictionary and prints the average grade for each student.
 Exercise 17: Simple Calculator
 ● Write a program that:
 ○ Defines a function calculate which takes three parameters: two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
 ○ Performs the operation and returns the result.
 ○ Ask the user for the two numbers and the operator, then call the function and print the result.
