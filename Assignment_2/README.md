# Assignment 2

This notebook contains the code for the second assignment in Python 1, covering various programming concepts such as functions, data filtering, and basic list manipulation.

## Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
### Write a FizzBuzz Function
Create a function `fizzbuzz(n)` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter.

### Implement FizzBuzz Logic
The function should print:
- **"Fizz"** for multiples of 3
- **"Buzz"** for multiples of 5
- **"FizzBuzz"** for multiples of both 3 and 5
- The number itself for other numbers

### Call the Function
- Call the function for numbers from **1** to **20**.

## Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering
### Create a List of Mixed Data Types
- Create a list that contains a mix of integers, strings, and floats.

### Filter the List
- Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the integers from the original list.

### Print the New List
- Output the filtered list of integers.

## Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List
1. **Create an Empty List**: Start with an empty list called `todo_list`.
  
2. **Define Functions**:
   - A function `add_task(task)` that adds a task to the list.
   - A function `show_tasks()` that prints all tasks in the list.

## Exercise 4: Temperature Converter
1. **Define a Conversion Function**: Write a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
  
2. **Print the Result**: Output the converted temperature for the following values:
   - **22ºC**
   - **46ºC**
   - **51ºC**
   - **76ºC**
