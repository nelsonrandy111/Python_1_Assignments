# Assignment_2
Code for the second assignment in Python 1

Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
 Write a FizzBuzz Function: Create a function fizzbuzz(n) that takes an integer n as a parameter.
 Implement FizzBuzz Logic: The function should print:
 ○ "Fizz" for multiples of 3
 ○ "Buzz" for multiples of 5
 ○ "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
 ○ The number itself for other numbers
 Call the Function: Call the function for numbers 1 to 20.

Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering
 Create a List of Mixed Data Types: Create a list that contains a mix of integers, strings, and floats.
 Filter the List: Use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the integers from the original list.
 Print the New List: Output the filtered list of integers.

Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List
 1. Create an Empty List: Start with an empty list called todo_list.
 2. Define Functions:
 ○ A function add_task(task) that adds a task to the list.
 ○ A function show_tasks() that prints all tasks in the list.

Exercise 4: Temperature Converter
 1. Define a Conversion Function: Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius) that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
 2. Print the Result: Output the converted temperature for 22ºF, 46ºF, 51ºF and 76ºF
