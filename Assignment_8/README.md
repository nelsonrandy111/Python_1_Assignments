# README: Assignment 8 - Data Visualization and Analysis

---

## **Project Overview**

Assignment 8 focuses on exploring and analyzing data using Python. It involves creating and manipulating DataFrames, calculating key statistics, and visualizing data using a point plot. The goal is to identify insights from the dataset, such as determining the course with the highest average grade.

---

## **Project Tasks**

1. **Create a DataFrame**:
   - Generate a dataset containing course names and corresponding grades for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create a point plot using the Seaborn library to visualize the average grades for each course.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate the average grades for each course.
   - Identify the course with the highest average grade and print the results.

---

## **Project Structure**

- `Assignmnet_8.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all tasks, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

---

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:
     - `pandas`
     - `matplotlib`
     - `seaborn`
   - Install the required libraries using pip if necessary:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

2. **Steps to Run**:
   - Open the `Assignmnet_8.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to perform all tasks.

3. **Expected Outputs**:
   - A point plot visualizing the average grades by course.
   - A printed statement identifying the course with the highest average grade.

## **Outputs**

- **Visualization**:
  - A Seaborn point plot showcasing the average grades for each course.
- **Key Insights**:
  - The course with the highest average grade is identified along with its average grade.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- The point plot includes a title and axis labels for clear representation.
- The plot is adjusted to handle long course names using rotated x-axis labels.
- The dataset used in the notebook is generated programmatically for demonstration purposes.
