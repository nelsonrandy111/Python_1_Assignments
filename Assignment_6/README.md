# README: Assignment 6 - Data Analysis with Netflix and Titanic Datasets

---

## **Project Overview**

Assignment 6 focuses on analyzing two datasets, Netflix and Titanic, using Python. The tasks cover data exploration, computation of specific statistics, and analysis of trends and insights based on the datasets. Key objectives include working with pandas for data manipulation and applying query-based filters to calculate results.

## **Project Tasks**

### **Netflix Data Analysis**
1. **Identify Missing Ratings**:
   - Calculate the number of missing values in the `rating` column.
2. **Analyze 2021 US Films**:
   - Count the number of titles released in the United States in 2021.
3. **Movies in 2020**:
   - Count movies from 2020 that have no missing information.
4. **Year with Most Titles**:
   - Determine the year with the highest number of releases.
5. **Average Annual Releases from 2010**:
   - Calculate the average number of releases per year starting from 2010.

### **Titanic Data Analysis**
1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Load and inspect the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and columns.
2. **Survival Analysis**:
   - Calculate gender-based survival percentages.
   - Compute survival percentages grouped by gender and passenger class.
3. **Data Presentation**:
   - Display results in a tabular format for clarity.

## **Project Structure**

- `Assignment_6.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for Netflix and Titanic dataset analysis.

---

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
     - `pandas`
   - Datasets required:
     - `netflix_titles.csv` (Netflix dataset).
     - `train_and_test2.csv` (Titanic dataset).

2. **Steps to Run**:
   - Place the datasets in the same directory as the notebook.
   - Open the `Assignment_6.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

3. **Results**:
   - Key statistics and analysis for each dataset will be displayed in the console.
   - Outputs include survival percentages, missing data counts, and insights into release trends.
