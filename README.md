This repository contains the assignments for the MSc Business Analytics program. Each assignment is organized into its own folder, with specific instructions and details provided in individual `README.md` files. The repository will be updated regularly as new assignments are completed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

Each assignment folder contains the necessary files, such as Jupyter notebooks, datasets, scripts, or other resources required for that specific task. Detailed information about each assignment can be found in the `README.md` file inside each folder.

## Assignments Overview

1. **Assignment 1**: This assignment contains 17 exercises covering some of the Python basics covered in the first session. Topics include: syntax and variables, lists and dictionaries, tuples and sets, control flow, and functions.

2. **Assignment 2**: This assignment contains 4 exercises again practicing the basics of Python. The main goal of this assignment was to practice the process of pushing updates using Git.

3. **Assignment 3**: This assignment contains 4 exercises regarding object-oriented programming, class creation, and manipulation.

4. **Assignment 4**: This assignment contains 7 exercises utilizing a number of basic Python libraries to access and manipulate a folder of files.

5. **Assignment 5**: This assignment focuses on analyzing annotation files and organizing them by month and year. Tasks include serialization using JSON and Pickle, sorting annotations chronologically, and adding datetime metadata to the dataset.

6. **Assignment 6**: This assignment involves analyzing two datasets: Netflix titles and Titanic data. Key objectives include identifying trends, calculating statistical insights, and manipulating DataFrames with Pandas.

7. **Assignment 7**: This assignment involves advanced Pandas operations, such as creating new columns, combining DataFrames, and extracting metadata using string operations. A key focus is merging datasets effectively and performing textual analysis.

8. **Assignment 8**: This assignment focuses on data visualization and analysis. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, tasks include creating a point plot to visualize average grades by course and identifying the course with the highest average grade.

## Getting Started

To run the assignments:
1. Install the required Python libraries:
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - Additional libraries mentioned in individual assignment READMEs.
2. Navigate to the respective folder for an assignment and open the Jupyter notebook.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the results.
